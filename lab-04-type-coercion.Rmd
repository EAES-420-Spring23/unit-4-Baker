# Learning goals

-   Learn how data types are coerced in vectors (or columns)
-   Practice creating mixed type vectors
-   Practice using explicit data coercion functions

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Data Coercion Figure - Hands-on Programming in R G. Grolemund", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-coercion.png")
```

# Getting started

If you're looking at this RMarkdown document in RStudio, then you've already cloned your Unit 2 repo from Github.
Good job!

As a brief reminder of the steps:

-   Use the Github link to generate your own private versin of the Unit's repo.
-   Name it `unit-X-yourlastname` within the `EAES-420-Spring23` Organization.
-   Copy the URL of the repo you created using the green `Code` button
-   Copy/clone it into a `New Project from a GitHub Repo` in RStudio Cloud.
-   Navigate to the exercise, lab, or homework folder using the `File` pane.
-   Open the R Markdown instructions `lab-X.Rmd` or `hw-X.Rmd` and, Knit.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. 🧶
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ✅
-   Push your changes to GitHub.️ ⬆️
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

## Data

For the first 6 exercises, we will use data objects we will create ourselves.
The last 4 exercises will use the `earthquakes` dataset from the `{openintro}` package we have used before and we will also need `{tidyverse}` for some data wrangling.

## Packages

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

## Warm up

Before we start the lab, let's warm up by changing the YAML in the starter file:

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. 🧶
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ✅
-   Push your changes to GitHub.️ ⬆️
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

# Lab Exercises

1.  Copy the three code chunks below into Exercise 1 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Beneath the **second** code chunk, add text narrative explaining why the output of the first code chunk is different from the second. Finally, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **third** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

**NOTE** Don't worry about code chunk labels in this Lab *unless* we tell you to add them.

-   Vector `c(1, 1L, "C")`

```{r echo = F}
1
1L
"C"
```

```{r echo = F}
c(1, 1L, "C")
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1, 1L, "C"))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

2.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 2 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(1:3, 5)`

```{r echo = F}
1:3
5
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1:3, 5))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

3.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 3 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(3, FALSE, T)`

```{r echo = F}
3 
FALSE
T
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(3, FALSE, T))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

4.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 4 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE))`

```{r echo = F}
TRUE
as.numeric(TRUE)
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE)))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

5.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 5 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1))`

```{r echo = F}
NA
FALSE
as.logical(1)
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1)))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

6.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 6 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object (*include the numerator and denominator of the division, separately, as well as the overall division operation together*). Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(1L / 0, "A")`

```{r echo = F}
1L
0
1L / 0
"A"
```

```{r echo = F}
#typeof(c(1L / 0, "A"))
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

## Last 4 Exercises: With "real" data

7.  Write and label a code chunk below exercise 7 in your starter file that gives you a "glimpse" of the `earthquakes` dataset.

8.  Under exercise 8, state which of the variables could be explicitly coerced to new data types, without any loss of information.
    Try to identify at least two.

9.  If we coerced `year` to type character, what visualization problems may arise if we tried to recreate the plot from Homework 1 which mapped `year` to the x-axis and `richter` to the y-axis?

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

10. Copy the code chunk below into exercise 10 in your starter file, then label and complete it! This pipeline **1)** creates a new variable called `major` which takes on the value `TRUE` for `richter > 7.5`; **2)** coerces the new variable to type numeric; and **3)** filters only for the major earthquakes. Remember to set eval = T to knit your starter file. **How many major earthquakes are there in this dataset?**

```{r label-me, eval = F}
___ %>% 
  mutate(major = case_when(
    ___ > 7.5 ~ TRUE,
    TRUE ~ ___
  )) %>% 
  mutate(___ = as.numeric(___)) %>% 
  filter(___ == ___)
```
