### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro) 
library(lubridate)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

```{r my-vectors}
numeric <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

character <- c("Seconds", "Minutes", "Hours", "Days", "Weeks")

mixed <- c(2, "Minutes", 6, "Hours", 10)
```

"numeric" is a `r typeof(numeric)` data type, "character" is a `r typeof(character)` data type, and "mixed" is a `r typeof(mixed)` data type.

"numeric" is a `r class(numeric)`vector, "character" is a `r class(character)` vector, and "mixed" is a `r class(mixed)` vector.

### Exercise 2

```{r data-frame , eval = T}
data_frame <- bind_cols("numeric" = numeric, "character" = character, "mixed" = mixed)
data_frame
```

This data frame is a `r typeof(data_frame)` and is a `r class(data_frame)`.
